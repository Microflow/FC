## City Building. 

111 In the 190s, John F Kennedy, set a diffiult goal. He said we should travel to the moon. His vision inspired engineers around the world. 

222 In 2022, is there a planetary goal? Is everyone cooperating towards a shared dream/target/vision. I see nothing. 

333 Can we build villages and cities better than the current ones? 

444 For me, visualizing and building villages, towns and cities of the future is a worthy and exciting goal. 

555 This is not an empty dream. In summer 2022, I went to two music festivals, in Hualien province, Taiwan. There were 2 to 3 thousand people there. They had electicity, water, food, music...

666 The fact is. In 2022, we have many new and exciting equipment which could help us build better cities. 

## Advanced Technology

777 I will talk about advanced building materials, new water technology, food preservation, farming.

888 To build a city you need multiple skill sets. it is a which take extroverts, introverts, marketers, researchers. 

999 What is my job? I ejoy researching, and setting a broad overview. I also like prototyping.  

AAA We could vizualize these skills sets.

BBB If we cannot build these cities yet, we shoul at least let ourselves dream. Because every enterprise starts from a simple dream. 

CCC How can you start an village of the future, when you only have 1000TWD?

DDD Well, you can spend a year acquitring the skill sets. Skills are move valuable than money. A village of the future, starts from the apartment of the future. Im learning to purify water, how to preserve food, how to make fires.
