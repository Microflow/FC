## City Building. 

In the 190s, John F Kennedy, set a diffiult goal. He said we should travel to the moon. The vision inspired engineers around the world. 

In 2022, is there a planetary goal? I see nothing. 

For me, visualizing and building villages, towns and citi4es of the future is a worthy and exciting goal.
