## City Building. 

In the 190s, John F Kennedy, set a diffiult goal. He said we should travel to the moon. The vision inspired engineers around the world. 

In 2022, is there a planetary goal? I see nothing. 

For me, visualizing and building villages, towns and citi4es of the future is a worthy and exciting goal. 

This is not an empty dream. In summer 2022, I went to two festivals. There were 2 to 3 thousand people presetn. They had electicity, water, food...

Teh fact is. In 2022, we have many new and exciting equipment which could help us build better scities. 

I will talk about advanced building materials, new water technology, food preservation.

To build a city you need multiple skill sets.
