## City Building. 

In the 190s, John F Kennedy, set a diffiult goal. He said we should travel to the moon. The vision inspired engineers around the world. 

In 2022, is there a planetary goal? I see nothing. 

For me, visualizing and building villages, towns and citi4es of the future is a worthy and exciting goal. 

This is not an empty dream. In summer 2022, I went to two festivals, in Hualien province, Taiwan. There were 2 to 3 thousand people there. They had electicity, water, food, music...

The fact is. In 2022, we have many new and exciting equipment which could help us build better cities. 

I will talk about advanced building materials, new water technology, food preservation, farming.

To build a city you need multiple skill sets. 

We could vizualize these skills sets.

If we cannot build these cities yet, we shoul at least let ourselves dream. Because every enterprise starts from a simple dream. 

How can you start an village of the future, when you only have 1000TWD?

Well, you can spend a year acquitring the skill sets. Skills are move valuable than money. A village of the future, starts from the apartment of the future. Im learning to purify water, how to preserve food, how to make fires. 

Look at cool pics. Tell stories. 

If one person can so it, anyone can.

Only hour per week.

the Partment of the Future. 

We call this the rat race. 

In England, we can take a step back from the rat race. 

I am not advocating a world without money. Just a word where we can provide more of our physical basics directly. It is already happening. I will show you the euqipemtn. Show the 5 star equipment, and also how you can build lower budget versions. 

Just listing equipment which could pragmatically help us relax.
